# OneSlotServer

This is a plugin for the minecraft spigot server.
It limits the number of playersa allowed on ther server to 1, while transfering the players inventory to all new players and providing a spectator mode for operators.

This plugin is still in development. Do not use it unless you are prepared to run into problems.
